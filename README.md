# Crud-Struts2-Hibernate ðŸ¤™
I use struts 2, spring, hibernate to do a CRUD

This application uses:
- Java (Struts2, Spring)
- Hibernate
- MVC (Model View Controller)

## Requirements ðŸ’»

- You need to create a persistence called "SgaPU" and a datasource "jdbc/PersonaDb", or just change their names in the file persistence.xml
- you could change the way to connect to the database, but remember the project works with JPA.

*Feel you free to use it* ðŸ¤“.
